"""
This module contains the logic for handling Stripe subscriptions.

The model for subscriptions is as follows:
- A member may have at most one membership subscription and at most one makespace access subscription.
- A subscription is a Stripe subscription.
- When subscription is created, we look at the current membership of the member and may schedule the subscription to start in the future instead of immediately.
- The member stores the Stripe subscription id, or the schedule id in the database (the schedule if the subscription is scheduled to start in the future).
- When subscriptions are paid, a transaction is added to makeradmin with an action that indicates that days should be added to their membership.
    - The order is shipped immediately.
- When a new member starts subscribing to makerspace membership, and they haven't signed the access agreement, we pause the subscription immediately after the first payment.
    - This is done since the member will not be able to get any makespace access until after they sign the makespace access agreement.
    - When the lab membership agreement is signed (and orders are shipped), we resume the subscription.
- Subscriptions may have binding periods. This means that the member will pay for N months in advance the first time they pay, and then the normal subscription will continue.
    - The binding period is set by the smallest multiple in the makeradmin product that corresponds to the subsscription.
    - Currently the binding period need to have the same price per month as the non-binding period.
- Subscriptions will use the price from the makeradmin product
- Subscriptions use custom product actions via transaction actions instead of the product action associated with the subscription product. This is because the number of days in a month varies.

Due to a limitation in how stripe works, we need to use a regular purchase for the first payment.
This is because stripe doesn't allow starting multiple subscriptions at the same time, which becomes a UX issue if the card requires 3D secure authentication
(we don't want the user to have to authenticate multiple times).
Therefore we use a regular purchase for the first payment, and then schedule the subscription to start at the next renewal date.
This logic is handled in the frontend.
