<h2>Improve your makerspace knowledge!</h2>
<p>Hello {{member.firstname}}. You have been a member for a while now and we hope that you have had time to work on many fun projects at the makerspace.</p>
<p>We have recently introduced a new quiz as a learning tool which all members must take. It will go through many common questions that members have.
 Since you have been a member for a while it might all be super easy, but there may be some nuggets of information there which you didn't know about.</p>
<p>Note that this is not intended as test of your knowledge, it is a way for members to learn how things work without having to read through a long and boring document.
Completing this quiz is a mandatory part of being a member. You will receive nagging emails every few days or so until you complete the quiz.
</p>
<p>The quiz only take a few minutes, just click on the link below to get started.</p>
