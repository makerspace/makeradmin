<h2>Improve your makerspace knowledge!</h2>
<p>Hello {{member.firstname}}. It looks like you haven't completed the Makerspace Quiz yet.</p>
<p>Completing this quiz is a mandatory part of being a member. It goes through many common questions that members have and things we want members to know about.
 Since you have been a member for a while it might all be super easy, but there may be some nuggets of information there which you didn't know about.</p>
<p>Note that this is not intended as a test of your knowledge, it is a way for members to learn how things work without having to read through a long and boring document.
</p>
<p>The quiz only takes a few minutes, just click on the link below to get started.</p>
